	<p> Invite friends and family to your event with a click of a button with the ease of security and confidential in mind. The concept behind this project is to create an event invitation and reservation system that can be used by a host. This system allows the host to either create an invitation template or to select a template from a set of pre-created templates. Once completed the host would have the ability to upload a CSV file containing the information of the receivers (first name, last name, address, email address). Each of these receivers would receive an email and a mailed invitation with the template and an option to RSVP or not. The framework consists of working through a Cloud based environment which has the most cutting-edge technology. Users can sign up for free and start inviting people right away without any limitation off datasets.</p>
